    "## Introduction\n",

    "There are several criteria which need to be kept in mind when choosing a pile type:\n",
    "- the degree to which the surroundings are influenced by vibrations and noise\n",
    "- the degree to which the installation of the pile leads to soil deformations\n",
    "- the value of the foundation load and the type of loading (compression, tension, bending, static or dynamic) \n",
    "- demands on force-displacement behaviour\n",
    "- durability\n",
    "- difficulties during execution\n",
    "- costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Each criterion has to be judged for each case separately. Execution aspects and difficulties are especially important. For example: a very weak soil can lack the strength to support the freshly casted concrete of a cast-in-place concrete pile (e.g. a vibropile). Another example: a wood pile cannot be driven 5 m into a sand layer without breaking. In the scheme on page fm4 the different pile types are sorted according to their application areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, driven piles lead to vibrations and noise in the direct surroundings. Therefore the first selection is usually based on the question whether pile driving is acceptable. This is important because driven foundations have important benefits over non-driven alternatives. For example:\n",
    "- driven systems can be calendered, which makes it possible to verify the assumed soil conditions during driving.\n",
    "- When driving a pile, it pushes aside the soil, thereby increasing strength and stiffness of the soil. The force-displacement behaviour is relatively stiff.\n",
    "- The pile shaft is relatively insensitive to the presence or absence of lateral soil pressure and groundwater flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vibrations\n",
    "Pile driving can cause nuisance due to vibrations and even lead to damage to adjacent buildings. This damage is caused by the reduced strength of the soil beneath the adjacent building, induced by the deformation of this soil caused by the vibrations. Pile driving at a distance of 2 m does usually not give problems, but can cause nuisance (e.g. cracks in plasterwork). If there is a possibility of vibrations, deformation of the soil due to vibrations or compaction due to vibrations, vibration-free pile systems \n",
    "can be used. These contain several screwed systems and drilled piles. By means of an isolation sheet, a sound reduction of 5 dB(A) is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Influence on surroundings\n",
    "While driving displacement piles, a temporary situation of perched water can occur which can lower the bearing capacity of adjacent foundations. Outside a circle with a radius of 8D (D= pile diameter) this effect is small. All screwed piles lead to a locally lower groundwater pressure. This relaxation can affect an area with a radius of about 4D to 6D. To keep the bearing capacity of existing piles intact, the cylinder of influence around the existing piles (about 2D) must remain undisturbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pile length & transport\n",
    "All driven piles have a maximum length, dictated by the driving equipment. A typical maximum length is about 40 m, of which 5 m is reserved for the driving ram. The maximum therefore is about 35 m. For prefab piles, another limitation is the slenderness of the piles. This affects transport and drivability of the piles. A a rule of thumb: the slenderness of a pile (length/diameter) may not exceed 80. In urban areas, where access roads may be narrow, an additional limit to pile length may exist. This can reduce the maximum pile length to about 25 m.\n",

    "Tip diameter: 150 - 500 mm  \n",
    "$F_{s;d}$: 400 - 3000 kN\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "In practice for prefab piles shaft stress of no higher than 12 N/mm2 is chosen. This means that the maximum bearing capacity of a pile with a width of 450 mm at most is 2500 kN. Note that the soil conditions always determine the bearing capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For standard foundations concrete of strength class C45/55 is used for piles 180 to 320. Prestress of 4 N/mm2 is commonly used. For heavy driving, for example in a 15 m sand layer, higher strength concrete can be used. Also the prestress is increased. Vibrations due to pile driving can lead to minor or major damage to adjacent buildings.\n",
    "\n",

    "- only smooth square shaft\n",
    "- design value of shaft bearing stress in practice no more than 12 N/mm2\n",
    "- concrete strength class: C25/30 to C50/60 with a prestress of 0 to 7 N/mm2\n",
    "- after driving the piles are broken at the head to enable the reinforcement of the pile to be connected to the structure.\n",
    "- piles are driven one by one\n",
    "- maximum angle approx. 1:3\n",
    "- age during driving >1 month \n",

    "```\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "Wood piles are still very useful, provided that the pile heads are driven at least 0,5 m beneath the lowest possible groudwater table. Concrete lengthening pieces can be used to bridge the groundwater zone. Despite the possibilities, wood piles are not used frequently. The characteristic wood stress is mostly assumed to be 7 N/mm2. In practice the bearing capacity of wood piles is limited to 130 kN. Wood piles gain their strength trough both tip resistance and friction.\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "A steel tube with loose footing plate is driven in the soil. The tube is provided with reinforcement and filled with concrete. Before the concrete hardens the tube is removed either by driving or vibrating. The footing plate remains in the soil. For cast-in-place piles the stresses during driving are absent (as the actual pile is not driven). The concrete strength used is far less than the ones used for prefab piles. In practice shaft stresses of about 12 N/mm2 are used. This type also occurs as combi- pile, where a prefab pile is placed in the casing during casting.\n",
