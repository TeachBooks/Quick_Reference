The dimensions of the column depend strongly on the buckling length. However, there is a big difference whether a column has to support an entire building with many floors or just the roof. Often, the column at ground level is the ‘dimensional’ column. A slender column with large buckling length could also be normative, even if it is not on the ground floor.\n",
