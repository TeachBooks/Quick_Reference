    "slabs have a thickness of 50 to 90 mm and a maximum length of 8500 mm. The protruding reinforcement trusses\n",
    "are calculated per project because the size depends on the load and span. The main reinforcement and trusses\n",
    "are placed parallel to the main span direction. Ducts can be casted in. In the structural topping additional\n",
    "bottom and top reinforcement can be placed. The topping is of strength class C20/25 or higher. Voids can\n",
    "be added in the fabrication process, and ground floors can be isolated at the bottom side of the slab. Propping\n",
    "needs to be done according to the fabricators instructions. Eventually the precast planks and topping act as one\n",
