    "Hollow core slabs are prefabricated floor elements. The hollow plates are prestressed and arrive on site fully\n",
    "prefabricated. The hollow cores save a considerable amount of weight compared to the massive slab floor.\n",
    "The savings can be as much as 50%. This means that also the main bearing structure and foundation can be made\n",
    "considerably lighter.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The floor concept is based on the following principles:\n",
    "- No voids.\n",
    "- No concentrated loads.\n",
    "- Free supports (no clamped supports)\n",
    "- Standard fire resistance\n",
    "- Deflection under variable load of max. 0,003 L\n",

    "\n",
    "In contrast to what one may expect hollow core slabs also offer opportunities for free formed floor plans. The use of hollow core slabs is not restricted to the rectangular floor\n",
    "plans used in offices and flats. Both round shaps as chamfered egdes are possible. It is important to realize that the plates can be cut under an angle.\n",

    "## Execution aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "Small voids can be directly applied in prefabrication. The floor slabs can also be ordered with cast in light sockets and electricity ducts. When using hollow core slabs it must\n",
    "be noted that the prestress causes a precamber of the unloaded plate. This is mainly an issue with larger spans. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Rules of thumb for this precamber are:\n",
    "- 1/1000 L with light prestress\n",
    "- 3/1000 L with heavy prestress\n",
    "  \n",
    "Depending on the stiffness of the floor slab, the bearing and the levelness of the bearing the slabs can be supported in different ways:\n",
    "- directly on the underlying structure\n",
    "- in mortar\n",
    "- on fabric\n",
    "- on elastomeric strips\n",
    "  \n",
    "For variable loads to 3 kN/m2 and spans up to 6,5 m all support variants are possible. In other cases the elastomeric strips are recommended.\n",
    "The common bearing length is 100 mm in residential buildings, and 150 mm in non residential buildings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "To activate diaphragm action of the floors there are several option. In order of increasing load:\n",
    "- Mortar filled joints with added reinforcement.\n",
    "- Coupling of the plates to each other and the structure by means of extra reinforcement.\n",
    "- Application of a structural topping with a tensile tie coupled to the structure.\n",
    "- A combination of the aformentioned provisions with a cast-in peripheral beam which contains the tensile tie.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The horizontal loads from the floor are transmitted by concrete ‘studs’ to the stabilizing elements of the building.\n",
