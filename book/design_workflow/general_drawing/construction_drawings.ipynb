    "In the supporting structure floor plan, we draw the structure through which we cut (at about 1 metre above the floor) as in a regular floor plan, with appropriate shading. However, the supporting structure floor plan is different from a regular floor plan because we also (mainly) draw the structure below the floor. Because we do not see these construction parts directly, we draw them with a dashed line. Often, for example, columns will be directly above each other, in which case we obviously don't see the dashed line, because we draw the cut column above the floor with a continuous line. \n",

    "Axonomentric drawing is an overview of the overall supporting structure. It provides insight into the spatial arrangement in both the horizontal and vertical planes. The vertical and horizontal force distribution of the structure is often easy to see from the Axo because all structural parts are given in a single view. The second important function of the Axo is to show how the supporting structure fits the architectural design intent. This is why you often put the axo on the presentation poster.\n",

In other cases, if the connection is not image-defining in the building, its design is often left to the structural engineer or contractor.\n",
