# General loads
```{tableofcontents}
```

This section will explain what possible loads and load combinations can act
on a structure. Loads are part of the greater group of ‘actions’. ‘Actions’
comprise all possible infuences on a structure (e.g. temperature
differences). In most cases the words ‘actions’ and ‘loads’ are synonyms.
Most information will be stated in tables and diagrams. From these the
actions can easily be determined. Before the design of a structure can
start, the designer must have a clear idea of the structure that needs to be
built. Or, put differently: what will be the functions of the structure? From
the functions of the structure the use of the structure can be determined. Once
the use of a structure is known, the possible actions can also be derived.

1. Idea of the structure   
2. Possible functions  
3. Use  
4. Loads  

First the loads, limit states and load combinations will be attended to.
After this introduction the different permanent and variable loads will be
adressed.
