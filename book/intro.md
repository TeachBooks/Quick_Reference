# Welcome to the new Quick Reference
This Jupyter Book serves as design guideline that replaces Quick Reference (QR) and Vademecum (VDM). The QR and VDM have been redeveloped  as Online Open Textbook, reusing, updating and adding to the existing content. We make use of the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) toolchain, of which the main components are:
- The [Teachbooks](https://teachbooks.github.io/) hosting platform
- [Github](https://github.com/TeachBooks/Quick_Reference) as platform to allow easy-access to and reuse of the open source material
- [MyST Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/typography.html), the language for the text source, an easy-to-learn markup syntax

The editors hope this fresh edition will serve new generations of students and professionals with their daily work in designing civil engineering and building structures. We also hope that you as reader will contribute, so that frequent updates can be published. To that end, please use the form at the lower end of this page, or directly link to our github environment.

`````{admonition} A little history...
:class: tip
Structural Engineering educators in the [Faculties of Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg) and [Architecture and the Built Environment (A&BE)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/architecture-and-the-built-environment) make extensive use of self-produced reference books containing drawing instructions, design tables, material properties, equations, examples
of structural elements, examples of calculations for dimensionsing of structural elements and
professional design drawings. Students use these reference books while participating in the many
Structural Design classes at the faculties of CiTG and A&BE. In 2002, the “Info Map
Constructieleer” was published by prof. Wagemans et al., in the format of a A4 ring binder which,
over the years, has been used by thousands of students in structural design education since. Already at that moment, the Infomap was a continuation of earlier publications with similar content. In
2011, the content was updated, translated into English, and renamed to Quick Reference. In 2021 the large parts of the QR were used to create a
similar resource at the Architecture faculty called ‘Vademecum voor draagconstructies van
gebouwen’, further abbreviated here as VDM. Until 2022, the QR and VDM were available as
hardcopy and distributed by the VSSD shop, with copyrights remaining at the Faculty of CEG and
A&BE. The old QR and VDM can be found here as PDF (https://tinyurl.com/Reference-Tables).
