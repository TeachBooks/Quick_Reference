    "The Octabube building is reviewed in this chapter. Three different versions of the Octatube are present, made out of concrete, steel and timber. The LCA is especially a powerful tool to compare different versions of a building regarding sustainability. The inputs and results of this calculation are done in the following file: [LCA calculation Octatube](../LCA/LCA_calculation_Octatube.xlsx).
