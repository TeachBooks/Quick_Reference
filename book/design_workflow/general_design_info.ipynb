    "## The design process\n",
    "\n",
    "The design process is part of the life cycle of a structure: the ‘idea-phase’, \n",
    "the ‘design-phase’, the ‘construction phase’, the ‘use and maintenance phase’, \n",
    "and the ‘demolition phase’. The structural engineer acts in the ‘design phase’. \n",
    "The terms ‘initiative’, ‘project definition’, ‘concept development’, ‘preliminary design’, \n",
    "and ‘verification of structural safety’ will be explained shortly below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initiative\n",
    "The client initiates a construction project or structure. The designer,\n",
    "being advised by an architect, determines design goals. The design\n",
    "goal is a general description of the desired result of the design and\n",
    "execution process. After determining the design goal, the\n",
    "designer can study different aspects of the project. For example: the\n",
    "location, the budget and functional requirements. When all aspects are determined, \n",
    "they are integrated and evaluated. The final step of this phase is to check whether \n",
    "the project is financially and logistically feasible. If this is not the case, \n",
    "the design goals need to be adjusted. The concequence of this is that the whole \n",
    "cycle starts again (aspects, integration, evaluation and check).\n",

    "`````{admonition} Result\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "A Program of Requirements (PoR) formulated by the client\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project definition\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the project, one first drafts a plan of action (strategy). This\n",
    "determines how to proceed in this phase, what the results should be and\n",
    "the criteria to which the result of this phase should be compared. Just like\n",
    "in the previous phase various aspect studies need to be done. Eventually\n",
    "this leads to the formulation of a report containing all basic assumptions\n",
    "concerning the structural design. This forms a supplement to the PoR.\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{admonition} Result\n",
    ":class: tip\n",

    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept development\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase too several studies have to be performed. The designer makes several\n",
    "‘structural’ concepts. To make a sensible design, she first analyses the force flow\n",
    "in both horizontal and vertical direction. Also the ability of the structure to retain\n",
    "its shape and place is investigated as well as the connections between different\n",
    "elements and parts of the building. After feedback from the structural assumptions\n",
    "at least two of the concepts are chosen for further analysis. With the aid of design\n",
    "tools (rules of thumb, diagrams and tables) the overall dimensions of the structure\n",
    "(including stability measures) are estimated and critical connections are studied\n",
    "for feasibility. The sections in this Quick Reference on different materials contain information on\n",
    "structural elements (such as precast conrete beams, hollow core slabs etc.)\n",
    "and tables with available (steel) profiles to come to reasonable dimensions. Already\n",
    "in this stage it is wise to orient oneself to different foundation possibilities as\n",
    "the foundation design will influence the above-ground structure and the other way around. \n",
    "The section on foundations provides the necessary information. Although the load bearing\n",
    "structure is now designed, this phase is not yet finished. Finally the designer needs\n",
    "to look into possible façades and roof elements. Now a choice can be made between\n",
    "the different concepts based on a multi criteria analysis. The criteria are based\n",
    "on the PoR and structural assumptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Preliminairy structural design\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all the dimensions of the chosen structure can be determined. Again the sections\n",
    "on the different materials can be helpful. Make sure, also in this preliminairy\n",
    "design, that stability of your structure is ensured. It is a good idea to search\n",
    "for alternative possibilities for the foundation and connecting structure to prevent\n",
    "surprises in the final design stage. Also the building envelope deserves some\n",
    "attention. Use the different examples given in the later chapters.\n",

    "## Preliminary design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase a further analysis of the strength, behaviour of the structure\n",
    "is made. Also the stability is checked, and necessary stability measures are added.\n",
    "To do this, quick calculations are made with simplified load combinations. The\n",
    "section on mechanics offers the necessary formulas and ‘forget-me-nots’. More\n",
    "attention is given to the foundation of the structure. Calculate the total vertical\n",
    "load and design a transition structure (which transfers the loads from the main\n",
    "load bearing structure to the foundation). Also a further analysis is made of the\n",
    "possible façades, roof elements and other building finishes needs to be made. How\n",
    "are the building finishes connected to the load bearing structure?\n",

    "\n",
    "The final preliminairy design of which the final dimensions are now determined,\n",
    "has to be checked with a structural code. In Europe this is the Eurocode. The\n",

    "Klompenhouwer (2015) has developed a flowchart that illustrates all steps in structural design and their logical order. The figure is shown below. It can be useful as a guideline for less experienced designers to help them organise their workflow and understand all necessary steps.
