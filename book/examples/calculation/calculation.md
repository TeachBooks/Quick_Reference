# Calculation examples
In this chapter, we dimension components of a support structure. A load-bearing structure serves to safely dissipate all forces acting on a building to the foundation. When dimensioning the components of a load-bearing structure, we estimate the dimensions as best we can using estimation rules or key figures. We then check with simple calculations whether these elements comply with the standard.

In the example calculations of this chapter, we assume a four-storey office building. For this office, we design a steel frame and, alternatively, a concrete frame. When dimensioning the column and beam, a control calculation is given throughout the text for both a steel structure (coloured blue) and a concrete structure (coloured grey). The calculation of other materials is done in much the same way. Where there are discrepancies, these are addressed.
