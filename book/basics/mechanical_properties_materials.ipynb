    "| Self Weight        | Small (4 to 10 kN/m³, depending on the species)  | Large (78.5 kN/m³) but relatively low self weight, large spans are possible (optimized cross sections); steel use per m² roof area: 0.3 to 1 kN | Large (24 kN/m³), this has consequences for the foundation and maximum span; not economical with low variable load | Large (24 kN/m³), this has consequences for the foundation dimensions; fairly large, but favorable with respect to buckling and deformation limits |\n",
    "| Fire Resistance    | Small dimensions have low fire resistance; Larger sections have good fire resistance | The structure has low fire resistance, but does not burn itself | Good resistance if the cover is sufficient | Less resistance than in situ concrete due to deterioration of the prestressing steel. Does not collapse easily, but is not reliable after a fire |\n",

If possible, use standard formwork. Avoid small amounts of concrete at great heights | Factory product with fast assembly on site. Extra stressing on site requires specialized tools and crew | N/A                                                      |\n",
